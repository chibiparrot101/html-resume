<p>
    Hi, I'm Tavishi! I am 21 years young and a French language and literature student currently learning front-end development. I enjoy working at the intersection of communication and technology as it weaves storytelling with design.
    I like approaching tasks with patience and curiosity, whether I'm researching, writing, or experimenting with code. I value clarity, collaboration, and steady growth and I'm excited to keep building my skills through real-world projects. 
    Apart from designing, I like to indulge in other forms of creative media, such as clay, acrylic paint and cinema.<br />
    I also happen to love blueberries and cats. <br />

    <br />

    I currently live in New Delhi, India.
