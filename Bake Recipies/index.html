    <h1>My Favourite Cakes!!!</h1>
    
        <p>
            I learnt most of these in mru from the home eco classes.<br />
            I also learnt to bake scones but I just never get them right. So apart from that, I'll try to note most of the recipes I remember, that I am good at.

        I've heard people calling it Sponge cake too, but I personally think that Sponge cakes are very different from pound cakes.<br />
        Texture wise, mostly. A sponge cake is usually lighter, as the whites are whisked separately. For the pound cake, whole eggs are whisked with the creamed butter and sugar. I have many fond memories of this sort of cake. The moments of baking and the satisfaction of sharing. This one is a crowd pleaser!
        </p>

    <h3>You will need;</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Large eggs, 3</li>
            <li>Sugar, 1 cup</li>
            <li>White flour, 1 cup</li>
            <li>Vanilla flavouring, 1 tsp</li>
            <li>Room temp soft butter, 1 Cup</li>
            <li>Baking powder, 1 tbsp</li>
        </ul>

        I am sharing the recipe exactly as I like to make it. I have mentionned all the tiny tricks that I have learnt and picked up from my teachers and just the peoples around me. I really feel like the tiniest changes make the biggest difference. Here are a few things I do differently;<br />
        <ol>
            <li>I do not use plain sugar. I first grind one cup of white sugar into the mixer until it turns into fine powdered sugar.</li>
            <li>I prefer to cream the three yolks first with the creamed butter and sugar, whisking in some of the whites, a little at a time. In my experience, this creates a very fluffly batter and helps the flour to rise during baking. Comes handy when I run out of Baking powder.</li>
            <li>I prefer to use butter, but frankly I have baked this very cake, following this very recipe with so many other fats too, like cream, malai and even ghee. From experience, all of them work great except for oil. That's a HUGE nono. The cake's gonna end up soggy and oily.</li>
            <li>I use a big spoon/spatula to mix the flour into the cream. I specifically use the cut and fold method as I have found that this method traps air very effectively in the batter, helping it rise.</li>
        </ol>
        These are some of the things that I have learnt. Some are from teachers, others from the internet but most of them come from trial and error. I honestly cannot remember how many pound cakes I have baked already, Lol!

    <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>    
            <li>Cream one cup of softened butter with one cup of finely ground sugar till the mix is smooth, creamy and even, or until the sugar has completely 'melted' into the butter.</li>
            <li>Egg part;</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Crack three eggs and separate the whites.</li> 
                    <li>Whisk the whites separately until it doubles and looks like shaving foam</li>
                    <li>Mix the yolks into the cream and add vanilla flavouring.</li>
                    <li>Once the yolks are well mixed, whisk the whites in a little at a time until well combined.</li>
                </ol>
            <li>Sift the flour little by little, mixing in a consistent 'cut n fold' method.</li>
            <li>Add in the baking powder with the last bit of flour.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 160 degree celcius for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Line a 15 cm baking tray with butter and parchment paper and por in the batter.</li>
            <li>Bake at 175 degree celcius for and 60 minutes.</li>
            <li>After an hour, check if cooked by poking the middle with a clean toothpick. If it comes out clean, the cake is ready! You can take it out and leave it to cool, Brava!</li>
            <li>If the toothpick doesnt come out clean, bake for another 10 minutes at the same temp.</li>
            <li>Serve with a glass of refreshing lemonade and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
