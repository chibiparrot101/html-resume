<h1>Tavishi's top 3 horror reccs</h1>
<h2>These are the most horrifying horror movies imo</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Vvitch</h3>
<p>No jumpscares, slow buildup, almost sh*t myself in the end.</p>

<h3>Heridatry</h3>
<p>
Disturbing, to say the least.<br />
Loved the ending.
</p>

<h3>The Grudge</h3>
<p>Back to the basics.<br />
 I think every horror movie enthusiast would agree that this one is real, REAL good.</p>
